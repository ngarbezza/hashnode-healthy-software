## Discovering IDEs: Expand and Shrink Selection

How many times do you find yourself using the mouse or pressing repeatedly the Shift+Arrow keys to get a particular selection you want? You might also be familiar with the double (or triple) click, but that is not enough to make a "smart" selection of code.

Here's one of my favourite features: the ability to **expand** the selection to the next logical piece of code, or doing the opposite effect, **shrink** it, using keyboard shortcuts.

This is particularly useful for refactorings, where you want to select valid chunks of code to manipulate them by triggering a refactoring.

## Example: VSCode

In VSCode, the feature is called "Expand Selection" and "Shrink Selection" and the default keybinding is `Shift+Alt+Right` and `Shift+Alt+Left` respectively.

## Example: Jetbrains

In Jetbrains products this option is available under the names "Extend Selection" and "Shrink Selection", and (at least on Linux) the default keybinding is `Ctrl+w` and `Ctrl+Shift+w` respectively.

How often do you use these features? I just posted two examples of the IDEs that I use the most, I'm curious to hear about how this looks in other IDEs!
